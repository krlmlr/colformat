# pillar

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hadley/pillar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hadley/pillar)

pillar provides tools for styling columns of data, artfully using colour and unicode characters to 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/pillar")
```

## Usage

pillar is not designed for end-users but will eventually be incorporated in packages like [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org).

```{r}
library(pillar)

x <- 123456789 * (10 ^ c(1, -3, -5, NA, -8, -10))
pillar(x)
```

If you render this in a console that supports colour, you'll see something that looks like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/colours.png")
```


## Inspirations

* [TextPlots](https://github.com/sunetos/TextPlots.jl) for use of Braille 
  characters
  
* [spark](https://github.com/holman/spark) for use of block characters.

The earliest use of unicode characters to generate sparklines appears to be [from 2009](https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/01/13/fuel-prices-and-pageviews/).

Exercising these ideas to their fullest requires a font with good support for block drawing characters. [PragamataPro](https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) is one such font.
